# modern_ruby_api_wrapper
Distributed Ruby app that wraps API calls that can't be implemented in Ruby 1.8.7

Used to implement API calls that cannot be implemented in older versions of Ruby (typically because of a version missmatch in SSL that cannot be easily solved in expired versions of Ruby).

## Test run

Start the server: `./modern_ruby_api_wrapper.rb`.

Run the client code: `ruby client_test.rb`.

Output: `The Modern Ruby API wrapper is running`.
